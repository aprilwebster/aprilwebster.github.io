								<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
								<h3>my day job</h3>
								<h4>software engineer, data scientist, statistician</h4>
							</header>
							<p>I'm a software engineer on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/">IBM Watson</a> team building tooling to help developers train and evaluate ML models. I develop applications using Node.js, React, Python and Java.</p>
							<p>I've also worked as a data scientist, a data analyst and a statistics consultant. A common theme across all these roles has been data, particularly on how to use and visualize it to help users make more informed decisions.</p>

					<section id="engineering">
						<div class="container">
							<h3>What I Bring</h3>
							<ul class="custom">
								<li><b>Full-Stack Development:</b> Hands-on experience across backend, frontend, APIs, and data systems. Comfortable working from concept to delivery, including prototypes, integration, and production deployment.</li>
								<li><b>API & Data Architecture:</b> Special focus on data products and developer experience—designing APIs that are intuitive, consistent, and usable. Includes metadata modeling, schema design, governance-aware architecture, and spatial data APIs.</li>
								<li><b>Technical Leadership & Delivery:</b> Experience as a tech lead, scrum lead, and project manager—guiding teams through planning, prioritization, estimation, and delivery. Skilled at balancing product goals, technical debt, and team capacity to deliver sustainably and strategically.</li>
								<li><b>Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:</b> Worked directly with clients and domain experts in healthcare, tourism, infrastructure, and utilities. Skilled at translating requirements into technical decisions and ensuring stakeholders are part of the process.</li>
								<li><b>User-Centered Engineering:</b> Engineering work grounded in usability, maintainability, and clarity. I build systems that are technically sound and intuitive to work with—because the best systems are the ones people can actually use and evolve.</li>

							<h3>Portfolio</h3>
							<p><em>Selected projects that bring together data modeling, system design, and user-centered engineering.</em></p>

							<h4>Data Modeling</h4>
							<ul class="custom">
								<li><b>Hybrid Healthcare + AI Data Model (IBM Research):</b> Designed a flexible and governance-compliant data model for AI/ML in clinical settings—balancing rigid healthcare standards with the flexibility of discovery-based workflows.</li>
								<li><b>Spatial Data API & Ontology Design:</b> Developed API models and ontology structures for spatial data standards as part of a research thesis integrating GIS and domain-specific schemas.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>System Design</h4>
							<ul class="custom">
								<li><b>Observability Framework for Population Health:</b> Created a modular, traceable architecture supporting insight, monitoring, and planning across diverse health data sources.</li>
								<li><b>Fleet Health System:</b> Designed predictive modeling pipelines and observability tooling to move from reactive to proactive automotive system maintenance.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Usability & User-Centered Design</h4>
							<ul class="custom">
								<li><b>Developer Tooling for AI Workflows:</b> Built front-end tools and API interactions to help developers explore, train, and evaluate machine learning models more effectively.</li>
								<li><b>Interview-Based Data Model Design:</b> Conducted interviews with stakeholders across tourism, infrastructure, and healthcare to model data in ways that align with how people actually describe and use it.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Observability & Monitoring Systems</h3>
							<p><em>From insight to foresight—designing systems that help us see clearly, act wisely, and prepare for what’s next.</em></p>
							<p>I build observability and monitoring systems across domains—from healthcare and automotive fleets to IT infrastructure and AI/ML systems. My approach integrates monitoring with forecasting—so we’re not just tracking the health of systems, we’re anticipating future needs, risks, and opportunities.</p>
							<h4>Where I’ve Worked:</h4>
							<ul class="custom">
								<li><b>Population Health Observability (IBM Research):</b> Hybrid data models that support both regulated healthcare data governance and AI/ML discovery—enabling insight, traceability, and proactive planning.</li>
								<li><b>Fleet Health Observability (IBM Research):</b> Predictive modeling and performance monitoring for automotive systems—helping organizations move from reactive maintenance to foresight-driven operational decisions.</li>
								<li><b>IT Systems Health (IBM AIOps + Instana):</b> Observability tools that surface meaningful signals across distributed systems—integrating anomaly detection, forecasting, and root cause analysis for reliability and resilience.</li>
								<li><b>Demand Forecasting Systems (Statistics & Economics Consulting Group, Arthur Andersen):</b> Statistical modeling and data analysis for predicting resource needs, operational demand, and system load—whether for healthcare, supply chains, infrastructure, or transportation.</li>
